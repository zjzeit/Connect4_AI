		- Led me to various sites giving information on strategic play, notably:
	2) http://www.connectfour.net/Files/connect4.pdf
		- Very influential on how to play the game with tactics, yet little was actually
		  implemented in code (with the exception of the idea that the center of the
		  board is valuable considering it has the greatest links available, thus contributing
		  to my evaluate function). Also this mentioned the idea of "even" and "odd" threats,
		  which I oversimplified in calculating all "threats" in my evaluation function.
	3) http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Connect_four#Theory
		- Explained basic theory in Connect-4, however was not implemented (though this matches
		  the idea of "threats" explained by Victor Allis
	4) http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.html
		- Gave examples of both minimax algorithms and alpha-beta pruning (however AB pruning
		  was not implemented; the minimax algorithm used was from the class slides.
